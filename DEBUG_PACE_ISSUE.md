# Debug: Pace String Issue

## Problem
Error: `"invalid input syntax for type numeric: \"07:04 /km\""`

This indicates that a pace string is being passed to a numeric database field.

## Why This Happens With New Activities Only

1. **Strava API Changes**: Newer activities might include additional fields
2. **Different Activity Types**: Some activity types return pace data
3. **API Response Evolution**: Strava may have added pace fields to newer activities

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Logs
Look in the browser console when running the sync for these log messages:

```
üîç Raw activity data from Strava: { ... }
‚ö†Ô∏è Found pace string in field 'field_name': "07:04 /km"
üîç Processed activity data for database: { ... }
‚ùå ERROR: Pace string found in processed data field 'field_name': "07:04 /km"
```

### Step 2: Identify the Field
The logs will tell you which field contains the pace string. Common suspects:
- `average_pace` (if Strava started returning this directly)
- `best_efforts` fields
- Custom pace fields in newer API versions

### Step 3: Fix the Field Mapping
Once identified, ensure that field is either:
1. Properly converted using `safeNumber()` 
2. Excluded from the database mapping
3. Mapped to the correct computed field

## Quick Fix Applied
The updated sync code now:
1. ‚úÖ Logs all incoming data to identify pace strings
2. ‚úÖ Converts pace strings to seconds per km
3. ‚úÖ Filters out any remaining pace strings before database insert
4. ‚úÖ Provides detailed error logging

## Next Steps
1. Run the sync and check the console logs
2. Identify which field contains "07:04 /km"
3. Update the field mapping accordingly
