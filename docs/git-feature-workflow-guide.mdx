# Git Feature Branch Workflow Guide

## 🔄 **Professional Feature Development Process**

This guide documents the complete Git workflow used to build the Activity Feed feature, following industry best practices for collaborative software development.

## 📋 **Workflow Overview**

The **feature branch workflow** is the standard approach used by professional development teams. It ensures:

- ✅ **Safe development** - Main branch stays stable
- ✅ **Team collaboration** - Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- ✅ **Quality control** - CI/CD testing before merge
- ✅ **Code review** - All changes reviewed via Pull Requests

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Start with Clean Main Branch**

First, always check your current state and sync with remote:

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# See recent commits and branch state
git log --oneline -2

# If needed, sync with remote
git pull origin main
```

**✅ Result:** We confirmed `main` and `origin/main` were synced at commit `ba5847e`

---

### **Step 2: Create Feature Branch**

Create a new branch for your feature work:

```bash
# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/activity-feed-analytics
```

**What this does:**

1. **Creates** a new branch from current `main`
2. **Switches** to that branch immediately

**✅ Result:** Now working on isolated feature branch

---

### **Step 3: Develop the Feature**

Build your feature incrementally:

```bash
# Create component directory
mkdir components\analytics

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install @headlessui/react @heroicons/react

# Create components:
# - ActivityFeed.tsx
# - ActivityCard.tsx
# - ActivityDetailModal.tsx
# - ActivityFeedClient.tsx
# - Modified app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx
```

**Best Practices:**

- ✅ **Small, focused commits** - One logical change per commit
- ✅ **Test as you go** - Verify each component works
- ✅ **TypeScript compliance** - Fix linting errors immediately

---

### **Step 4: Stage All Changes**

Prepare your changes for commit:

```bash
# Stage all modified and new files
git add .

# Alternative: Stage specific files
git add components/analytics/ActivityFeed.tsx
git add app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx
```

**What this does:**

- **Tracks** all new files and changes
- **Prepares** them for the next commit
- **Gives you control** over what gets committed

---

### **Step 5: Commit the Feature**

Create a permanent snapshot with descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add paginated activity feed with detailed view - ActivityFeed, ActivityCard, ActivityDetailModal components with 90-day filtering, pagination, and comprehensive metrics"
```

**✅ Result:**

```
[feature/activity-feed-analytics 8a2c597] feat: Add paginated activity feed...
7 files changed, 875 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 components/analytics/ActivityCard.tsx
create mode 100644 components/analytics/ActivityDetailModal.tsx
create mode 100644 components/analytics/ActivityFeed.tsx
create mode 100644 components/analytics/ActivityFeedClient.tsx
```

---

### **Step 6: Push Feature Branch**

Upload your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/activity-feed-analytics
```

**✅ Result:**

```
* [new branch] feature/activity-feed-analytics -> feature/activity-feed-analytics

Create a pull request for 'feature/activity-feed-analytics' on GitHub by visiting:
https://github.com/karltiama/endurorevamp/pull/new/feature/activity-feed-analytics
```

**What happens:**

- 🔄 **CI/CD pipeline triggers** automatically
- 🧪 **Tests run** (TypeScript, linting, build verification)
- 📋 **PR creation link** provided

## 📊 **Visual Git Flow**

```mermaid
gitgraph
    commit id: "ba5847e (main)"
    branch feature/activity-feed-analytics
    checkout feature/activity-feed-analytics
    commit id: "8a2c597 (feature)"
    checkout main
    merge feature/activity-feed-analytics
    commit id: "merge commit"
```

### **Branch States:**

#### **Before (Starting Point):**

```
main          o---o---o (ba5847e) ← You were here
             /
origin/main  o---o---o (ba5847e)
```

#### **After Creating Feature Branch:**

```
main          o---o---o (ba5847e)
             /
feature      o (new branch created)
```

#### **After Development + Commit:**

```
main          o---o---o (ba5847e)
             /
feature      o---o (8a2c597) ← Your new feature
```

#### **After Push to GitHub:**

```
main          o---o---o (ba5847e)
             /
feature      o---o (8a2c597)
             /
origin/feature o---o (8a2c597) ← Now on GitHub
```
