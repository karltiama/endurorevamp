# Onboarding Modal Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive onboarding modal system for your running app that allows users to set and configure their goals during the signup process. This follows your development approach of building features incrementally with proper testing and professional structure.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Tables Created (`sql/onboarding_goals.sql`)

1. **`goal_types`** - Predefined goal categories users can choose from
2. **`user_goals`** - User's selected goals with targets and progress tracking
3. **`goal_progress`** - Detailed progress entries (can be populated from Strava activities)
4. **`user_onboarding`** - Tracks onboarding completion status

### Key Features

- **Flexible Goal System**: Supports distance goals, race preparation, fitness improvement, etc.
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic progress updates from Strava activities
- **Row Level Security**: All tables have proper RLS policies
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new goal types without code changes

## 🔧 Implementation Structure

### Core Components

```

└── 🎮 Demo (app/onboarding-demo/page.tsx)
```

### Goal Types Included

- **Weekly Distance Goal** - Set weekly running targets
- **Monthly Distance Goal** - Set monthly running targets
- **Race Preparation** - Prepare for upcoming races
- **General Fitness** - Improve overall fitness
- **Weight Management** - Support weight goals through running
- **Running Consistency** - Build consistent running habits
- **Speed Improvement** - Improve pace and speed
- **Endurance Building** - Build long-distance capacity

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup

```bash
# Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard
psql -h your-host -U postgres -d postgres -f sql/onboarding_goals.sql
```

### 2. Test the Implementation

Visit `/onboarding-demo` in development to test the modal:

- Select goals and configure targets
- Watch the onboarding status update
- Test the full flow end-to-end

### 3. Integration with Auth Flow

Add the modal to your post-signup flow:

```tsx
// In your dashboard or post-auth component
import { OnboardingModal } from '@/components/onboarding/OnboardingModal';
import { useOnboardingStatus } from '@/hooks/useGoals';

export function DashboardPage() {
  const { hasCompletedOnboarding } = useOnboardingStatus();
  const [showOnboarding, setShowOnboarding] = useState(!hasCompletedOnboarding);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your dashboard content */}

      <OnboardingModal
        open={showOnboarding}
        onOpenChange={setShowOnboarding}
        onComplete={() => {
          setShowOnboarding(false);
          // Optional: redirect or show success message
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Strava Integration

The second step of onboarding connects to Strava. Update the Strava OAuth callback to mark this step complete:

```tsx
// In your Strava callback handler
await fetch('/api/onboarding', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    strava_connected: true,
    current_step: 'complete',
  }),
});
```

### 5. Goal Progress Updates

Connect goal progress to Strava activities. In your activity sync process:

```sql
-- This function is already created in the schema
SELECT update_goal_progress_from_activity(
  'user-id',
  activity_distance,
  activity_date,
  'strava-activity-id'
);
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The implementation includes:

- **Hook tests** for React Query integration
- **API endpoint tests** (you can add these)
- **Component tests** (can be added using React Testing Library)
- **Demo page** for manual testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test hooks/useGoals
```

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Goal Types**
   - Training plan integration
   - Heart rate zones
   - Cadence targets
   - Elevation gain goals

2. **Progress Visualization**
   - Charts and graphs
   - Weekly/monthly summaries
   - Achievement badges

3. **Goal Recommendations**
   - AI-powered goal suggestions
   - Based on past performance
   - Seasonal adjustments

4. **Social Features**
   - Goal sharing
   - Community challenges
   - Progress comparisons

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

✅ **Modular Design** - Each component has a single responsibility
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage
✅ **Scalable Database** - Flexible schema supports any goal type
✅ **Secure** - Row Level Security on all tables
✅ **Testable** - Clear separation of concerns
✅ **React Query Integration** - Optimistic updates and caching
✅ **Professional UI** - Consistent with your existing design system

## 🔧 Customization

The system is highly customizable:

- Add new goal types via database inserts
- Modify UI components for different branding
- Extend goal data structure with JSONB fields
- Add custom validation rules per goal type

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user goal management while maintaining your high code quality standards and testing discipline.
